# Pig-Game-Project
Pig Game project created in HTML CSS and JavaScript

A part of The Complete Javascript Course 2021: Zero To Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This project uses Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with an emphisis on modern JavaScript. Mastery of my craft is important to me.
So, I took the time to add instructions on how to play "The Pig Game" as I have never heard of it and doubtless their are others who haven't either.
